# Criminal Empire official website

This was the official website for Criminal Empire, a mobile game by GoldSlugz Games and NCSOFT.  I originally designed this site in Adobe Photoshop and Adobe XD when I was part of NC's Marketing team.  The site was implemented by the Web Dev team in mid-2020 ahead of the game's launch in Asia.

The game has since been decommissioned, but I took this as an opportunity to practice coding by rebuilding and coding the site myself.
